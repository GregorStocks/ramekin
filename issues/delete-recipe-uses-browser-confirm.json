  "description": "In ramekin-ui/src/pages/ViewRecipePage.tsx line 194, recipe deletion uses window.confirm() for the confirmation dialog. MealPlanPage and ShoppingListPage both use proper Modal components for their delete confirmations. The browser confirm() is inconsistent with the app's design language and blocks the JavaScript thread.\n\nFix: Replace the confirm() call with a Modal-based confirmation dialog, matching the pattern used in MealPlanPage (deletingMealPlan signal + Modal) and ShoppingListPage (deletingItem signal + Modal).",
