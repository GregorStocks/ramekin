  "description": "In ramekin-ui/src/pages/ViewRecipePage.tsx, the component fires 3 GET /api/recipes/:id requests on initial mount:\n\n1. loadCurrentVersionId() at line 548 (fetches recipe just to get versionId)\n2. loadRecipe() at line 549 (from onMount)\n3. loadRecipe() at line 556 (from createEffect initial run - SolidJS effects always run once on creation)\n\nFix: Remove the onMount entirely. Let the createEffect handle the initial load (it already runs on creation). For loadCurrentVersionId, fold its logic into loadRecipe (which already sets currentVersionId when vid is null, line 169-171). This would reduce 3 requests to 1.",
