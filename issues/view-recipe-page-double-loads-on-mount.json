  "title": "ViewRecipePage loads recipe twice on mount",
  "description": "In ramekin-ui/src/pages/ViewRecipePage.tsx, onMount (line 548-549) calls loadRecipe(), and then the createEffect (line 553-557) that tracks versionId() also calls loadRecipe() on its initial run (Solid effects always execute once on creation). This means every recipe page visit fires 2 identical GET /api/recipes/:id requests.\n\nFix: Remove the loadRecipe() call from onMount and let the createEffect handle it, or gate the effect so it doesn't fire on the initial run.",
