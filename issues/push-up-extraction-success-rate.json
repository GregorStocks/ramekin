Improved from 164/5370 (3.1%) by enabling reqwest content decompression (fixing hostthetoast.com, asweetpeachef.com) and filtering ~1000 non-recipe URLs from the test set (category pages, blog posts, roundups, lifestyle posts). Remaining failures are mostly JS-rendered sites (sprinklebakes.com 79/100) and scattered older posts without structured data.",
