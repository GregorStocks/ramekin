  "description": "The ShoppingListPage (ramekin-ui/src/pages/ShoppingListPage.tsx) only displays and manages existing items. Users can only add items via the 'Add to Shopping List' button on individual recipe pages. There's no way to manually add a freeform item (like 'paper towels' or 'olive oil') directly from the shopping list page.\n\nThe API already supports this - CreateShoppingListItemRequest has source_recipe_id as optional. The UI just needs an add-item form or button on the shopping list page.",
