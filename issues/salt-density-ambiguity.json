  "description": "\"salt\" is the #1 unknown ingredient in the density gap report (1,093 occurrences), with \"kosher salt\" at #2 (592) and \"sea salt\" / \"fine sea salt\" adding another 277. Currently all salt variants are mapped to null (explicitly ambiguous) because Diamond Crystal and Morton kosher salt have very different densities by volume. Research whether we can just default \"salt\" to kosher salt (or table salt) since that's what most recipe authors mean, and figure out a reasonable policy for the other salt variants.",
