  "description": "~1100+ fixtures have amounts like '0.5', '0.75', '1.5' that could be displayed as '1/2', '3/4', '1 1/2' for readability. This is a presentation choice - current behavior isn't wrong, just less idiomatic for recipes. Would need a conversion function for common decimals. Low priority.\n\nSee doc/ingredient-parsing.md for workflow and file locations.",
