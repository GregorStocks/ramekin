  "title": "CookbookPage defines its own PhotoThumbnail instead of using shared component",
  "description": "CookbookPage (ramekin-ui/src/pages/CookbookPage.tsx lines 174-210) defines a local PhotoThumbnail component that fetches /api/photos/{id}/thumbnail with a size param, while the shared components/PhotoThumbnail.tsx fetches /api/photos/{id} (the full image). The local version silently swallows fetch errors with no user feedback, and doesn't clean up blob URLs properly (missing onCleanup).\n\nThe shared component should be extended to support thumbnail fetching with an optional size parameter, then CookbookPage should use it instead of its own copy.",
