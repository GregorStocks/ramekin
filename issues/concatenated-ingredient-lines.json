  "description": "Unknown count of cases where multiple ingredients end up on one line like '3/4 cup (180ml) milk 1/4 cup (60ml) vegetable oil'. This is an extraction bug upstream (ingredients should be on separate lines), not a parser bug. The parser can't reasonably split these without risking false positives.\n\nSee doc/ingredient-parsing.md for workflow and file locations.",
