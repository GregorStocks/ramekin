  "description": "~2 fixtures (paprika) have lines with multiple quantities for different use cases, like '4 cups vegetable broth (for dried but soaked chickpeas), 1 1/2 cups vegetable broth (for cooked chickpeas)'. Currently only the first measurement is extracted; the second alternative ends up in the item field. Tricky because comma normally separates item from prep notes. May need special handling for patterns where text after comma starts with a number+unit.\n\nSee doc/ingredient-parsing.md for workflow and file locations.",
