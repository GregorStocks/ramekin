  "description": "Some non-recipe URLs remain in the test set after filtering improvements. Recent work added: category slug blocklist for /recipes/ paths, -recipes-and- roundup pattern, and collection-keyword roundup patterns. This removed 11 non-recipe URLs.\n\nRemaining non-recipe URLs in the test set (not worth filtering due to false positive risk):\n- How-to/technique posts (e.g. smittenkitchen how-to-poach-an-egg) - filtering risky since some how-tos ARE recipes\n- Non-food recipe content (e.g. marthastewart compost-tea-recipe, barefeetinthekitchen DIY produce wash) - has -recipe suffix, hard to distinguish\n- Merchandise/sale posts (loveandoliveoil sale.html, designs.html) - too site-specific\n- Blog posts without recipes (sprinklebakes christmas-at-workshop) - no URL signal to distinguish\n\nThese are tracked as extraction failures in the P2 issue rather than filtering problems.",
