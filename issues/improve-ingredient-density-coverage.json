  "description": "Many common ingredients lack density entries or aliases in curated.json, causing volume-to-weight conversion to silently skip them. For example, mayo and mustard had no entries despite being common tablespoon-measured ingredients. We should audit pipeline results (volume_stats.skipped_unknown_ingredient) across our recipe corpus to find the most common gaps and add curated entries/aliases for them.",
