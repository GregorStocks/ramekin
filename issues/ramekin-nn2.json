  "description": "~62 lines start with '& ' or '+ ' followed by fractions/amounts, like '& 1/2 cups flour' or '+ 1 tablespoon sugar'. These are orphaned continuations from split 'X & Y' or 'X + Y' amounts. The parser could strip these leading symbols to parse the remaining amount correctly. Related to but distinct from the 'and/or/plus' word issue (ramekin-5b8).\n\nSee doc/ingredient-parsing.md for workflow and file locations.",
