# Before adding an entry:
# 1. Verify all user input is passed via .bind() parameters
# 2. Verify no string concatenation/formatting with user input
# 3. Document why Diesel DSL couldn't be used
#
# Each entry should be reviewed when the code changes.

# tags.rs: Uses sql_query for unnest() which isn't in Diesel DSL.
# Safe: user_id is passed via .bind(), no string interpolation.
